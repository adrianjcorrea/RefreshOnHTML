         <p>Edith Wharton included a private meeting between characters Mr. Newland Archer and Countess Ellen Olenska at the Parker House 
           in her celebrated work of the early 20th century, The Age of Innocence. Archer is told that the Countess Olenska is staying in
            Boston at the Parker House, and he flees Newport to meet her there.

            The 2011 Grammy award-winning Parker Quartet, both founded and currently based in Boston, is named after the hotel.

          This is a WONDERFUL place to stay in Boston. It's an historic landmark, as it is the oldest continually operating hotel in the country. 
          On the Freedom Trail, right next to Beacon Hill and very close to the Boston Common. It's across the street from 
          the school that Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin and John Hancock attended. </p>

            If you are looking for history, great location in Downtown, this is it. Grand lobby with old world decor and opulence. We opted to upgrade 
            our reservation the day before which gave us a larger king suite. Other reviews talked about the size of regular rooms, but real estate
            square footage is expensive. If you are looking for a larger room, pay a little more.  Other plus, our king size bed was a great fit for us!
